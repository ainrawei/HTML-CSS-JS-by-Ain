  <h1>Nurul Ain Binti Rawei</h1>
    <p>Technical Writer at AVANA</p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Nurul Ain Binti Rawei. I am a former customer service advocate who decided to take on a new path and now pursuing my passion in writing.</p>

    <p>I am now a technical writer, and I am currently working at AVANA, an emerging startup that offers a social commerce platform and related services to SMEs. I create tutorials and user guides for merchants, documentations for stakeholders, maintain the knowledgebase to ensure it is up to date, and conducting competitive research on e-commerce services.</p>

    <p>I graduated with Bachelor of Arts in English Language from Universiti Putra Malaysia in 2015. Before that, I first went to Universiti Teknologi Mara and graduated with Diploma in Business Studies in 2011.</p>

    <p>I started working in 2016. I joined CIMB Group as a trainee under Skim Latihan 1Malaysia program. After I completed the program in mid-2017, I became a part of Allianz as a Customer Service Executive on contractual basis.</p>

    <p>Once my contract with Allianz ended, I became a Content Administrator at Forest Interactive. My roles were to manage content for telco services in Malaysia and abroad and liaise with creators and providers on content-related matters in timely manner. I worked with Forest Interactive from September 2018 to March 2019 before I took a break from working and continued with creative writing and drawing.</p>

    <p>I joined AVANA as a Customer Success Associate in January 2020. I helped merchants to set up and utilize AVANA platform to sell and promote their products and services to their customer. A year later, I became a part of Product team as a Technical Writer until now.</p>

    <p>Some of my writings were featured in a few blogs. I have participated in a few writing competitions such as contests by Buku Fixi, and I got to perform at Rantai Art Fest in December 2019. In addition, I read out my own writings as well as works by local and international literary figures in my podcast “hopes and heartbreak by ain rawei”.</p>

    <p>I have created a collection of doodles and digital illustrations which are available in my Instagram account @dedes.and.moomles. Some of my works have been featured by a few official Instagram accounts, such as Thurston Waffles, Wallace and Gromit, and #KLsketchnation.</p><br>
